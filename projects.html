                <li>This project involves user input and threads. The purspose of the project was an experiment to see
                    if I make a user and a computer interact with each other in an intelligent way. It did not work and the computer
                    tended to just insult the user. Wich devolved even further into a game wich insults the player every time they make a mistake
